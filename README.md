**Darbot Windows Agent** is a powerful automation agent that interacts directly with Windows at the GUI layer. It bridges the gap between AI Agents and the Windows OS to perform tasks such as opening apps, clicking buttons, typing, executing shell commands, and capturing UI state—all without relying on traditional computer vision models. This enables any LLM to perform computer automation instead of relying on specific models for it.

- **Python 3.12 or higher**
- **[UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** (recommended) or `pip`
- **Windows 10 or 11**
- **English Windows locale** for optimal UI Automation compatibility

### **Installation Steps**

**Install using `uv`:**

```bash
uv pip install darbot-windows-agent
```

Or with pip:

```bash
pip install darbot-windows-agent
```

## ⚙️Basic Usage

```python
# main.py
from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI
from darbot_windows_agent.agent import Agent
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

llm=ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model='gemini-2.0-flash')
agent = Agent(llm=llm,browser='chrome',use_vision=True)
query=input("Enter your query: ")
agent_result=agent.invoke(query=query)
print(agent_result.content)
```

## 🤖 Run Agent

You can use the following to run from a script:

```bash
python main.py
Enter your query: <YOUR TASK>
```

## 🚧 Troubleshooting

### Common Installation Issues

**Dependency Resolution Error:**
If you encounter dependency conflicts during installation:

```bash
# Try with upgraded pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install darbot-windows-agent

# Or use UV for faster dependency resolution
pip install uv
uv pip install darbot-windows-agent
```

**Python Version Issues:**
Ensure you have Python 3.12+ installed:

```bash
python --version
# Should show Python 3.12.x or higher
```

**Import Errors:**
If you encounter import errors, ensure all dependencies are installed:

```bash
pip install langchain langchain-google-genai pyautogui uiautomation
```

### Runtime Issues

**UI Automation Failures:**
- Ensure Windows is set to **English locale**
- Run the agent with **administrator privileges** if needed
- Some applications may require specific timing adjustments

**Agent Not Responding:**
- Check that the LLM API key is properly set in your `.env` file
- Verify network connectivity to the LLM service
- Monitor system resources (CPU/Memory)

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What LLM providers are supported?
A: The agent supports multiple LLM providers through LangChain:
- **Google Gemini** (recommended)
- **OpenAI GPT** models
- **Groq** models  
- **Ollama** (local models)
- **Anthropic Claude** (via LangChain)

### Q: Does this work on older Windows versions?
A: The agent is optimized for Windows 10 and 11. Windows 7-8 may have limited compatibility due to UI Automation API differences.

### Q: Can I use this for commercial purposes?
A: Yes! The project is MIT licensed, allowing commercial use, modification, and distribution.

### Q: How secure is the agent?
A: The agent runs locally on your machine and only communicates with the LLM API you configure. No data is sent to third parties without your explicit configuration.

### Q: Can I add custom automation tools?
A: Absolutely! The agent is designed to be extensible. See the [Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT.md) for instructions on adding custom tools.

## Vision

Talk to your computer. Watch it get things done.

## ⚠️ Caution

**This software enables automated control of your Windows desktop.** By using this software, you accept full responsibility for any actions performed by AI agents or automated systems built with this tool.

• Agent interacts directly with your Windows OS at GUI layer to perform actions  
• While the agent is designed to act intelligently and safely, it can make mistakes  
• Mistakes might cause undesired system behavior or unintended changes  
• **Recommendation**: Try to run the agent in a sandbox environment first  
• **Administrator privileges** may be required for some automation tasks  
• **English Windows locale** is recommended for optimal compatibility

Use at your own risk and ensure you understand the implications of automated desktop control.
